# AI-Driven Product Intelligence Platform for B2B SaaS

## Overview
This project simulates a real-world Product Intelligence system for a B2B SaaS
company (similar to Planview), designed to unify product usage, engagement,
and account health into actionable business insights.

The goal is to move beyond dashboards and build a decision-support system
that helps Product, Customer Success, and Leadership teams proactively
manage retention and growth.

## Problem Statement
B2B SaaS companies often struggle to answer:
- Which accounts are at risk before renewal?
- Which features actually drive engagement and retention?
- Where should Customer Success teams focus their effort?
- How can product usage be translated into clear business actions?

This project addresses those challenges end-to-end.

## Why This Matters

product data can be structured, interpreted, and operationalized to drive
retention, expansion, and better product decisions.
