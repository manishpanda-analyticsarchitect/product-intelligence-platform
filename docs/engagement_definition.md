# Product Engagement Definition

## What is Engagement?
Engagement represents how consistently and meaningfully users interact
with the product to achieve real value.

It is not a single metric, but a combination of behaviors.

## Engagement Dimensions

### 1. Feature Breadth
Measures how many different product features are used by an account.
Higher breadth indicates deeper product adoption.

Example:
- Low: Uses only task creation
- High: Uses tasks, reporting, collaboration, and admin features

---

### 2. Feature Depth
Measures how intensively features are used.
Higher depth indicates stronger reliance on the product.

Example:
- Low: Few actions per week
- High: Frequent daily actions

---

### 3. Stickiness
Measures how frequently users return to the product.

Example:
- High stickiness: Daily or weekly active users
- Low stickiness: Monthly or irregular usage

---

### 4. Recency
Measures how recently users interacted with the product.
Recent usage is weighted more heavily than older usage.
