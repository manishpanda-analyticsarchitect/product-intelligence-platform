# Churn Model Explainability

## Key Drivers of Churn Risk

The churn prediction model is designed to be explainable for business users.

Based on model coefficients:

- Lower engagement scores strongly increase churn risk
- Fewer active days are associated with higher churn probability
- Accounts with more active users show lower churn risk
- Broader feature usage correlates with better retention

## Why Explainability Matters
Rather than acting as a black box, this model allows Product and Customer
Success teams to understand why an account is flagged as risky and take
targeted action.

This improves trust, adoption, and decision-making.
